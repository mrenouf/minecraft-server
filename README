This is a decompilation of the Minecraft Server, for experimental 
purposes only.

I love Minecraft and I love Java so it's only natural for me to want to
peek under the hood and see how it works. There is also a large 
community interested in modding.

I felt the current situation involving partially decompiled and heavily 
obfuscated code was far less than ideal. Many of the mods have severe 
bugs that I could help resolve, if the full source for the server was
visible.

This is an attempt to rectify the situation. As of now I have fully
reversed the class files into compilable java source. The server 
starts and runs, however there are still issues so don't expect this 
to work as-is. I could use some help tracking down mistakes I may have 
made.
